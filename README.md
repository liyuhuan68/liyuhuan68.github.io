## Key Researches/Projects
- **Capstone Project** *A Group Project*

  **Tittle**: A Retrospective Cohort Study of Combined Pharmacist and Primary Care Interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Management
  
  **Sponsor**: Valley View Health Center

  **Summary**:
  - Compared diabetes control outcomes between diabetic patients receiving both pharmacist-led and primary care interventions versus those receiving primary care alone.
  - Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) was used to evaluate longitudinal changes in A1C, systolic blood pressure, and weight and also conducted Time-to-Event analysis.
  - Mostly responsible to longitudinal analysis, including models and methods, and overall structures.
  - Found that pharmacist-led and primary care combined interventions provided some benefits in A1C reduction but were not superior for patients with initially high A1C levels. The primary care only group achieved better A1C control over time, suggesting that pharmacist involvement may not always enhance diabetes management outcomes, but they do have positive effects on helping patients to control the diabetes, especially at an early stage.

- **Dog Aging Project** *Paper Submitted*

  **Title**: A cross-sectional analysis of C-BARQ behavioral characteristics in more than 47,000 dogs enrolled in the Dog Aging Project from 2020 to 2023

  **Supervisor**: Prof. Annette L Fitzpatri, Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington
  **Summary**:
  - Conducting data management and analysis of the behavior of over 47,000 dogs from the Dog Aging Project, DAP (https://dogagingproject.org/) across four cohort years to alert caretakers to potential illnesses or injuries, aiming at shedding light on similar patterns in the human aging process.
  - Establishing baseline behavioral data by specific dog characteristics for enrolled DAP dogs which can be used for additional longitudinal studies.
  - Responsible for data analysis and modelling to compare baseline trends between cohorts enrolled each year over the lifetime of the project, writing the paper as Co-first Author.

- **Study of Active LifeStyle Activation** *Research Assistant*

  **Supervisor**: Prof. Chongzhi Di, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center

  **Summary**:
  - Providing statistical support for a randomized trial to test adaptive interventions to improve diet and physical activity using an innovative Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design (n=403).
  - Responsible for accelerometer data processing and analysis, including data cleaning, visualization and summarization. Promptly estimating differences in sedentary time between baseline and 3 months for each participant to inform study team on the 2nd stage randomization assignment within the SMART design.
  - Exploring the use of deep learning algorithms to estimate sitting and characterize sitting accumulation patterns using high-resolution (30 Hz) raw accelerometry data.
